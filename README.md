Welcome to FP DDD (Functional Programming and Domain Driven Design)!

This blog introduces how pragmatic Functional Programming fits really well with Domain Driven Design.

You will find concrete examples and DDD book annotated with Functional Programming examples.

While progamming is important, feedbacks are also important and observability is a good way to achieve this. Another blog dedicated to observability is available at [https://o11y-weekly.github.io/](https://o11y-weekly.github.io/)
